Use the dataset - "Datset_Play.csv" to predict whether it is possible to play outside based on the weather input!
The target variable is "Play".

What to do:
    1. Split the data into training and testing parts :  80% for training and 20% for testing.
    2. Train the model using KNN and note down the output of your program for the following :
        i. Accuracy
        ii. Confusion Matrix
        iii. Prediction Play for feature matrix :
              Prediction 1: [1,2,2,1]  
              Prediction 2: [0,1,1,0]
              Prediction 3: [1,2,1,1]
