K-Means Clustering Algorithm:

It is one of the easiest and popluar unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
Unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only the input vectors without using the outputs.

According to AndreyBu:
“the objective of K-means is simple: group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns. To achieve this objective, K-means looks for a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset.”

A cluster is a collection of data points lying together due to certain similarities.
We define a value K, which refers o the number of centroids we need in the dataset.
The "means" in the title implies that the data will be averaged to find the centroid.

How it works:

The algorithm starts with a randomly located centroids used as starting points for all clusters. 
The it performs repetitive calculations to optimise the positions of these centroids. 

This process of optimisation of locations is stopped when:
    1. teh centroids have stabilised
    2. the defined number of iterations have been achieved
   
It is easy to understand and delivers results quickly. 
The disadvantage is that its performance is not as competitive as those of the other clustering algorithms. 
Also, clusters are assumed to be circles or spheres; this can affect the accuracy of the result.
