Question: Apply Kmeans clustering to divide the customers into various clusters based on their brand loyalty score and price sensitivity score

Suppose, Amazon wants to divide its customers based on the brand and price of the product they purchase. 
They want to know how many prefer Brands and how many prefer Price. 
So that they will offer their product to the respective types of customers accordingly.
Some customers prefer a Branded product without giving importance to its price. 
Some customers prefer Cheap priced products without giving importance to their brand. 
Some customers give importance to both Price and brand of the product and then proceed to purchase.

Customers who give importance to price are: Price sensitive 
Customers who give importance to Brand are: Loyal to Brand

In this dataset, we have the customers Price sensitivity score and Brand loyalty Score.
So Dataset has two columns: 
    1. brand_loyality_score
    2. price_sensitivity_score. 

Each row contains the brand loyalty score and price sensitivity score based on their expenditure. 
Both thefeature have values on a scale of 1-10. 

Now We can see that we have brand_loyality_score and price_sensitivity_score which we can take as our feature variable. 
But we dont have a label variable or target variable. 

So this is the problem of unsupervised ML algorithms.
Thats why we are using K-means in this case.

Task is to use the K-means algorithm to divide the customer base.
Predict the cluster for the following new data:
   [9.3,5.36]
