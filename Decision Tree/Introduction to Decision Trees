Decision Tree Algorithm:

A decision tree is a structure similar to a flow-chart in which:
    1. each internal node is a test on a feature of input values
    2. each leaf node represents a decision taken on the output (known as class label)

The path from the root to the leaf node represents the classification rules.

Decision trees are constructed via algorithmic approach that identifies ways to split data based different conditions. 
It is classified as "Supervised Learning" - "non-parametric Supervised Learning" to be exact.

There are 2 types of decision models:
    1. when variable can take discrete values: called classification trees
    2. when variable has continuous values (real numbers): called regression trees

Advantages:
    1. Easy to use and understand
    2. can handle both types of data (categorical and numeric)
    3. requires little to none data preprocessing

Disadvantages:
    1. Prone to overfitting
    2. Can create biased learning trees if some classes dominate
