SVN - Support Vector Machine

The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyper-plane in an N-dimension that distinctly classifies the data points.
Here, N is the number of features.

To separate the two classes of data points, there are many possible hyper-planes that can be chosen.
The objective is to choose the plane that is the farthest from from both classes - that is it has the maximum margin.

These hyperplanes are are decision boundaries which help to classify the data. 
The dimension depends on the number of input features. 
If number of input features is 2, the hyper plane is a line, and if input features are 3, the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane.
It is difficult to imagine the hyper-planes when the number of input features is more than 3.

Support vectors - these are data points that are close to the hyperplanes. 
We can maximise the margin of the classifier using these points.
Deleting these points can be harmful as this will change the position of the hyperplane.
