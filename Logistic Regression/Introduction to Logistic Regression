Logistic regression:
It is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
At its core, it uses the logistic function, also called sigmoid function. 
It was developed by statisticians to describe properties of population growth in ecology, rising quickly and maxing out at the carrying capacity of the environment.

It is an S-shaped curve that can take any real valued number and map it into a value between 1 and 0, but never exactly 1 or 0.

1 / (1 + e^-value)
where e = base of natural logs

It is very similar to linear regression - it uses an equation as the representation. 
Input values (x) are combined linearly using weights or coefficient values to predict an output value (y). 

A key difference from linear regression is that the output value being modeled is a binary values (0 or 1) rather than a numeric value.

an example logistic regression equation:
y = e^(b0 + b1*x) / (1 + e^(b0 + b1*x))
where:
y = predicted output
b0, b1 = coefficient for single input value x
x = input value

Logistic regression models the probability of the default class.
Logistic regression is a linear method, but the predictions are transformed using the logistic function. 
The impact of this is that we can no longer understand the predictions as a linear combination of the inputs as we can with linear regression.
